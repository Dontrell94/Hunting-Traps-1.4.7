Hunting-Traps
=============

This mod adds traps for hunting into the game that can be used to capture any mob! To set most of the traps a pressure plate must be lain on top of it.

1) The "Cage Hunting Trap" will spawn a cage around any mob that DARE walk over the pressure pad!

2) The "Fire Hunting Trap" will spark, and set any mob nearby on fire!

3) The "Pit Fall Trap" will make the ground below disappear, and send any mob in a 2x2 radius falling!

4) The "Igniting Fire Trap" will disintegrate any block that is placed on it, and can only be turned on and off by a distance.

5) "Spikes" are deadly little things that capture the mob, and slowly kill them, watch out.

6) "Grass & Sand Coverings" are based off an older mod, these are thin grass blocks that you can fall through, and here is the cool thing, it incorporates a self built engine that makes the blocks, match your biome grass color and the texture of any users texture pack.

7) "Invisible Pressure Plates" are 99.9% invisible pressure plates that act like normal pressure plates but are totally invisible, have no visible hit box, and make no noise.

8) "Grass Pressure Plates" are like the Invisible ones but look like your texture pack/biome.
